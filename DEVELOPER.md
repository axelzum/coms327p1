#### Part B
Missed 10 points in part A for incorrectly adding two sine waves in gendial. Fixed
in part B to average the sine wave values instead of averaging the frequencies.

Implementation of no filename argument uses methods from part a.

#### Part A
Could use better input validation for the 10-digit phone number user input in main2.c.
